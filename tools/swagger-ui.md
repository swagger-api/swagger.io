##Swagger UI

Swagger UI is a dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically
generate beautiful documentation and sandbox from a Swagger-compliant API. Because Swagger UI has no dependencies, you can host it in any server environment, or on your local machine. Head over to the [online demo](http://petstore.swagger.io) to see what it looks like for any publically accessible Swagger definition.


## How to Use It

### Download
You can use the swagger-ui code AS-IS!  No need to build or recompile--just clone this repo and use the pre-built files in the `dist` folder.  If you like swagger-ui as-is, stop here.

##### Browser support
Swagger UI works in all evergreen desktop browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox). Internet Explorer support is version 8 (IE8) and above.

### Build
You can rebuild swagger-ui on your own to tweak it or just so you can say you did.  To do so, follow these steps:

1. `npm install`
2. `gulp`
3. You should see the distribution under the dist folder. Open [`./dist/index.html`](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/develop_2.0/dist/index.html) to launch Swagger UI in a browser

### Development
Use `gulp watch` to make a new build and watch for changes in files.

### Build using Docker

To build swagger-ui using a docker container:

```
docker build -t swagger-ui-builder .
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 swagger-ui-builder
```

This will start Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Usage, Customization and Configuration 

Head over to the [GitHub Page](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/README.md) for more documentation for now!
