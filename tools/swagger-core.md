##Swagger-Core

swagger-core is a set of java libraries for generating and consuming Swagger defintions built around JAX-RS - head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core) for the source-code and examples on how to start using it.

### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

* Java 6 (http://java.oracle.com)
* Apache maven 3.0.4 or greater (http://maven.apache.org/)
* Jackson 2.4.2 or greater

### To build from source (currently 1.5.0)
```
# first time building locally
mvn -N
```

Subsequent builds:
```
mvn install
```

This will build the modules.  To build sample apps, activate the `samples` profile:

```
mvn install -Psamples
```

Of course if you don't want to build locally you can grab artifacts from maven central:

`http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/wordnik/`

## Sample Apps
There are a number of sample apps in the [samples](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/blob/master/samples) folder.
