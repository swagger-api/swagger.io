## Swagger Tools
In addition to the [Community Driven Tools for Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger.io/blob/wordpress/integrations/open-source.md), the core Swagger team drives a set of core tooling, all [open-source](https://github.com/swagger-api) and licensed under the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
