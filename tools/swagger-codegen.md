##Swagger Codegen

The Swagger codegen project allows generation of both client libraries and server stubs from a Swagger definition. Once you've read through the below please head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/develop_2.0) to get the latest sources.

### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

* [Java 7](http://java.oracle.com)

* [Apache maven 3.0.3 or greater](http://maven.apache.org/)

After cloning the project, you can build it from source with this command:

```
mvn package
```

Note!  The templates are included in the library generated.  If you want to modify the templates, you'll need to either repackage the library OR specify a path to your scripts

## Samples, Getting Started, etc
